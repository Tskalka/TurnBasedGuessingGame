# Overview

My goal is to apply what I have learned into Java. This is my first time using Java so a big goal for this was to have a deep enough understanding of the syntax of Java.

This is a turned based random number guessing game. There are two players that alternate guessing a number. After guessing the secrent random number is higher or lower. The game ends when the number is correctly guessed

This was created so I could practice using OO programming in Java and to understand syntax.
